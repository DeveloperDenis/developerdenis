# developerdenis
A group of C/C++ files I reuse across many different projects.

### Denis_Types
A collection of typedefs that I like to use to simplify using 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit variables.

### Denis_Math
Contains structures like vectors and rectangles and operations that can be performed on them, as well as other commonly needed math operations.

### Denis_Strings
Basic functions that work on C-style strings, and some for char arrays. Functions like, checking for equality, duplication, and tokenization.

### LL
Bare-bones linked list implementation.
